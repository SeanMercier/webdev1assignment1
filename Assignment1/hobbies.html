        Here are my 3 main hobbies:

        <main>     
                    
        <aside id="Cooking"><h3>1: Cooking</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy cooking as it allows me to experiment with new flavours and textures and it helps me pass time when I have to free time on my hands. I inherited this hobby thanks to my mother and grandmothers who have fed me over these past 18 years. </p></aside>
            <br>
                   
            <aside id="Netflix"><h3>2: Netflix</h3>
                    <p>This is more of a bad habit than a hobby to be honest, but it personally is the best thing for me to use when I am travelling or just want to take a breather from studying. It leads to great conversations with friends and family about our opinions on the latest shows or movies that have come out. However, this usually ends up making me procrastinate even longer.
                    </p></aside>
                
        <br>
                    
        <aside id="GO"><h3>3: Going Out</h3>
                    <p>Everyone likes going out, some more than others, but the main thing is to enjoy it while it lasts, and do your best to get up the morning after for lectures. As someone coming over from France, I can guarantee that the legend about Irish people drinking well is very TRUE.
