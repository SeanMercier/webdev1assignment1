                <article> <h2>My name is Sean Patrick Mercier.</h2> I am 19 years old and am studying my first year of <i>Applied Computing</i> in <a id="witlink" href="https://www.wit.ie/"><b>WIT</b></a>.</article><br>
        
        <div class="box1">
            <p class="pnumb1"> I have 2 younger brothers and a dog back in France.  <br>
            I moved over to Waterford from France in September 2021 and plan to live here until the end of my Applied Computing course in 4 years time, or 5 if I chose to pass a Master's instead of a Bachelor's between now and then. 
        </p></div>

            I have studied in France nearly all of my life as I spent a year living in Greystones, Wicklow, for 3rd class. 
            <br>
            My dad is French, and mum is Irish, which has allowed me to be a perfectly fluent bilingual student. In addition to this, I have been learning Spanish for over 7 years now and I do my best by talking to friends from Madrid, to keep my level up as much as possible.
        </p></div><blockquote><i>PS: This is not the exact plan but it is a blurry vision of a desired future in life :).</i></blockquote>
  
             <div class="box3"> <p class="pchangecolortored">
            I often get asked if I prefer France over Ireland or vice versa, but I've been raised in such a way that I see both countries as equals with their pros and cons. However, I have to point out that the transportation system in Ireland is horrendous compared to the one in France. 
            <br>
            Once I graduate, I plan on, hopefully, working in an IT company or startup for example, and aim to make the technologies of our period as efficient and simple as posible. All of this is an idea of my future life thinking about it from the present, but as we all know, life is full of surprises, good and bad, but ultimately, the objective is for my future family to live even better than I have so far.
